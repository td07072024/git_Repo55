The Atharvaveda or Atharva Veda (Sanskrit: अथर्ववेद, IAST: Atharvaveda, from अथर्वन्, "priest" and वेद, "knowledge") or Atharvana Veda (Sanskrit: अथर्वणवेद, IAST: Atharvaṇaveda) is the "knowledge storehouse of atharvāṇas, the procedures for everyday life".[3] The text is the fourth Veda, and is a late addition to the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism.[4][5][6]

The language of the Atharvaveda is different from Rigvedic Sanskrit, preserving pre-Vedic Indo-European archaisms.[7][6] It is a collection of 730 hymns with about 6,000 mantras, divided into 20 books.[6] About a sixth of the Atharvaveda texts adapt verses from the Rigveda, and except for Books 15 and 16, the text is mainly in verse deploying a diversity of Vedic meters.[6] Two different recensions of the text – the Paippalāda and the Śaunakīya – have survived into modern times.[8] Reliable manuscripts of the Paippalada edition were believed to have been lost, but a well-preserved version was discovered among a collection of palm leaf manuscripts in Odisha in 1957.[8]
